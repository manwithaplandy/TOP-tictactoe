# TOP-tictactoe
Tic-tac-toe game from The Odin Project

Created to practice fundamentals of OOP in Javascript, including public & private functions, classical inheritance, constructors and factories, and modules.

The goal is to have as little global code as possible - everything should be tucked into modules, and as much should be private as possible.
