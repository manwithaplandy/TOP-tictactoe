# TOP-tictactoe
Tic-tac-toe game from The Odin Project

Created to practice fundamentals of OOP in Javascript, including public & private functions, classical inheritance, constructors and factories, and modules. Also used to teach myself typescript which was very helpful in eliminating a lot of the errors I commonly find myself coming across.

The goal is to have as little global code as possible - everything should be tucked into modules, and as much should be private as possible. 

This app was designed for mobile to practice building mobile web apps, so some features from the prompt were left out to make the UI more efficient. No breakpoints were added for larger screens.
